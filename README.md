Python API of Asus WebStorage service, and a fuse file system

Working in progress Python Module to Asus WebStorage and a fuse filesystem for Asus WebStorage.

The fuse filesystem is read-only, but plan to add full write access.

The python module is incomplete.

You will need to provide Asus Developer sid, progkey and web storage account name and password in order to run the fuse filesystem. It has only been tested on linux.
